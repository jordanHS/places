### Description
_A project to create and build a places (visited) app according to specs:_

Create a web application that takes an input and writes, updates, deletes to the app.


### App should:

- Spec: Accept user inputted text
Input: "text"
Output: "text"
- Spec: The program displays inputted text
Input: "text"
Output: "text"
- Spec: Each destination should be an object with multiple properties(ie. like location, landmarks, time of year, notes, etc.)
- Spec: Input text to display in a "Places" List one line at a time
Input: "input a"|input b"
Output: "input a"| "input b"
- Spec: Display those properties when a user clicks on a place's name.
Input: "Done" (option chosen)
Output: "Stricken LineItem" 'Done'.

## Use Case:
A user should be able to enter a new to do list and see new results over and over again.

- Example: If a user inputs a to do list, the program should display a list of values:
<br/>
Input: "input a"|input b"
Output: "input a"| "input b"
